# cryptayoga

Cryptography is the Dharma of numbers.

This teaching is in three parts.
* The emptiness of numbers,
* suchness of resulting appearances,
* and the practice yoga taught in three parts
   * hashing
   * signing
   * cyphers

## The Birth of Numbers

All things appearing to be self-existent can be understood by
[three pairs of characteristics (lakshana)](https://plumvillage.org/books/understanding-our-mind).

* universal and particular
* unity and diversity
* formation and disintegration

Of these pairs, the first of each causes things to appear as undifferentiated.
The opposing quality appears as a result of the second.

Relativity between differentiated and undifferentiated results in the appearance
of accumulation among divisions, resulting in various forms of measure.

The name given to each of these units of measure is "number." Variations between languages
and even variations in numeric base all have this as their root.

Beings from another world would know nothing of 1, 2, 3, or the rest of them. If
they have ten fingers, they'll likely have a number system based in 10. If they
appear to have descriminating consciousness, they'll have numbers. If they do not 
have descriminating conscioussness, they may be Buddha.

Now that we have the idea-concept of "numbers" we also have "not numbers." Some
things are numbers, and some things are not numbers, these terms are characteristics
of their appearance.

We call the ***space*** in which numbers appear the "realm of numbers." This space is
not said to be self-existent, it co-dependently arises with the field of relativity
the appears between all numbers as the separation between that field and "not numbers."

Within the realm of numbers, dualistic appearances describing this space are termed 0 and Infinity.

The apparent incrementation in relativity between the two is co-depedent with an opposing decrementation. This results in the appearance of negative numbers.

## Numbers as Data

Computation is a method in which energy passes through a series of binary gates. Data is the appearance of information ascribed to the continuity that appears in the differences in the state of each gate as energy appears to move through it.

These descriptions are recorded to solid state material (storage) and copied over many forms of energy transmission. The information is understood to represent an ever increasing variety of things, occupying and ever increasing amount of collective attention.

The numbers used to describe a single gate are 1 and 0. The space in which they are observed is termed bit.

Using 8 of these spaces, we have a continuous sequence of 8 numbers of either 0 or 1. This space is termed byte.

There are 256 possible configurations of bits in a byte possible in the observable space. As we add more bytes the potential configurations grow exponentially.


* The truth of numbers appearing in the realm of one bit are 1 or 2.
* The truth of numbers appearing in the realm of one byte are of 256 unique names.
* The truth of numbers appearing in the realm of two bytes is of 65535 unique names.
* The truth of numbers appearing in the realm of four bytes is of 2147483647 unique names.
* Such is the truth of all numbers appearing in sequences of bits of a uniform size.


Since all relativity in the available number space can be understood this way, we can derive power from the observable laws governing the space.

If we are given a random number, we know that number is one of a limited number of possibilities determined by the size being observed.

If we take many random numbers and sort them, and we then wish to check if a particular number is included in this collection, we can predictably seek into the arrangment using the law of averages to perform a search.

As such, secure randomization is the source of all power in the realm of numbers.

What power?

The power of prediction, derived from the entanglement of such randomization and the laws of numbers observable in a fixed space.

By expanding this space, and the rules governing the expanded space, computation process can be produced that result in three derivative powers.

* Hashing, a process in which data of an indeterminate length results in consistent fingerprint that fits within a fixed space and is securely separated from all other fingerprints (securely random).
* Signing, a process in which a secure fingerprint is produced that is unique to a secret [very large number] holder who can verfiably identify such a signature as being derived from their secret without sharing the secret.
* Cypers, a process in which a continuity of input data is securely randomized and decodable by the holders of a secret [very large number].

These are methods of understanding numbers as data which do not require prior agreement or coordination to understand. One must only know the consistency of process in order to produce compatible proof, and this remains true for all subsequent processes built from these powers that stays within the realm of cryptography, meaning that it stays within the realm of numbers as they appear within each act of observation.
