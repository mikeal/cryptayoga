## The Birth of Numbers

All things appearing to be self-existent can be understood by
[three pairs of characteristics](https://plumvillage.org/books/understanding-our-mind).

* universal and particular
* unity and diversity
* formation and disintegration

Of these pairs, the first of each causes things to appear as undifferentiated.
The opposing quality appears as a result of the second.

Relativity between differentiated and undifferentiated has the appearance
of accumulation among divisions, resulting in various forms of measure.

The name given to these units of measure is "number." Variations between languages
and even variations in numeric base all have this as their root.

Beings from another world would know nothing of 1, 2, 3, or the rest of them. If
they have ten fingers, they'll likely have a number system based in 10. If they
appear to have descriminated consciousness, they'll have numbers. If they do not 
have descriminating conscioussness, they may be Buddha.

Now that we have the idea-concept of "numbers" we also have "not numbers." Some
things are numbers, and some things are not numbers, in terms of the characteristics
of their appearance.

We call the space in which numbers appear the "realm of numbers." This space is
not said to be self-existent, it co-dependently arises with the field of relativity
the appears between all numbers as the separation between that field and "not numbers."

Within the realm of numbers, the dualistic appearances describing this space are 0 and Infinity.
